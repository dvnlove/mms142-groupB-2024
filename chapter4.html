      <h1>Chapter IV: Why are wearable devices disruptive?</h1>
      <h3>New versus Old</h3>
      <p>The emergence of wearable devices has revolutionized medical care in the health industry. 
        Devices even for health monitoring have replaced traditional methods of health monitoring to descriptive and informational data use. 
        Instead of relying on information from physical checkups (Luong, 2024) and interviews with patients (KMS, 2024), wearables can monitor heart rates, sleep patterns, and other recorded activities in real time (Luong, 2024).
        This allows both patients and doctors to check up on these pieces of data to identify trends and patterns and to prescribe health improvements proactively (Luong, 2024).
        This also includes checking on the health status of patients and their previous behaviors (KMS, 2024). Another example of this is their use in physical fitness, where users of said technologies monitor their heart rates, calories burned, and other fitness data to give insights for future personal health improvement (Luong, 2024).
        In a nutshell, wearable devices offer advantages to health monitoring such as their prescriptive use of logged data hence it has grown positively popular (Casselman et. al, 2017) against traditional health monitoring.

  <h2>Unique Features That Disrupt The Health Industry</h2>
  <h3>Wearable sensor (Casselman et. al, 2017)</h3>
  <p>One of the most useful features that sparked the popularity of wearable devices are wearable sensors. These sensors collect physiological data of the wearer such as heart rates and blood pressure (Luong, 2024). These would also record activities such as sleep score and daily step count (Banaee et. al, 2013). Data is then recorded in real time for the wearer to get insights on their health. Analytics are then conducted afterwards to set goals for their next sessions (Luong, 2024). The use of wearable sensors is very popular for individuals who want to track their fitness analytics and improve their physical health in their own time. There is also demand in sports, particularly in sports medicine, where athletic and fitness professionals monitor their health and fitness (Patel et.al 2015 & Rialle et. al, 2002).</p>
  <p>Wearable sensors are also used to save lives. The SimpleWave was invented by CEO of Simple Wearables Angelo Umali in response to the death of his grandmother who died unaware of the severity of her falling down (Buban 2015). It tracks the steps and movements of the wearer, detects falls, the cause of the fall (whether due to seizure or trips) and the intensity of the fall. Which then alerts the caretaker assigned to the elderly wearer (Buban 2015).</p>

      <h3>Data entry, exit, storage, and transfer (Erkılıç, C. E., & Yalçın, A. ,2020)</h3>
  <p>One of the most revolutionary features of wearable devices is the recording, saving, storing, and transfer of gathered data (Erkılıç & Yalçın ,2020). This is in line with today’s Information Age where data analytics and information can shape people’s lives and opportunities in any field such as the health industry. Once the data is gathered via sensors (Luong, 2024), the data is logged, analyzed, and stored for the wearer as easy access information to be processed. These devices are also capable of data transfer. Health analytics can be shared to health professionals for prescriptions and recommendations. This data can also be communicated by Bluetooth (Erkılıç & Yalçın ,2020). This feature is popular in most medical fields, such as cardiovascular health, physical fitness, and many more because caretakers and nurses can monitor their patients' health and get notified in real time (Buban, 2015).</p>

      <h2>Examples of impacts and products on the market</h2>
    <h3>Apple Watch</h3>
      <p>The Apple Watch is a smart wearable device that allows the user to track heart rate, number of steps, calories burned, and sleep data. It also includes other features aside from health and fitness monitoring, such as music players and notifications integrated from the iPhone that is connected (Veenstra, 2018).</p>
      <p>The introduction of the Apple Watch led Apple to be the third biggest wearable vendor in 2016 and continued to grow in the market over the next few years, including the release of its newer versions (Veenstra, 2018). At first, Apple wanted to sell the Apple Watch as a luxury product. But due to this growth in demand, they instead improved the product to be focused around health and fitness (Veenstra, 2018).</p>

  <div class="report-section">
    <h3>FitBit</h3>
    <p>In 2014, FitBit was released as a smart watch and became influential in the health and fitness wearable market (Veenstra, 2018), much earlier than the Apple Watch. It sold around 10 million wearables that year and shipped 22 million more worldwide in the next year (Veenstra, 2018).</p>
    <p>
      FitBit devices also record numerous health and fitness data from its users, including the number of steps, distance traveled, heart rates, location data, and usage (Veenstra, 2018). FitBit uses this data and its services to make the user have more control over their data, and to make it more personalized in order to develop new features for their product (FitBit, 2018).
